# Introduction to Databases Course Portfolio Project
Programmers: Haruka Banin and Kelsey Shanks

This project is a transactional database made to support a made-up musical score retailer called Aria Archive.
We created a MySQL database with a React web application user interface that lists each table on a different page with various types and levels of CRUD operations.

The frontend folder holds the UI data for the React.js application.
The backend folder holds the server and database data.
The SQL file is simply for reference for the SQL used in the database design and manipulation queries and is not to be run.
To run the program, you'd need to run the backend and the frontend parts of the application.
